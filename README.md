An AI tool made specifically for data analysis!

I made this AI data analytics tool mostly for fun, but also to understand more about data analytics and AI agent implementations. 

## Features
1. It can receive any CSV file, and will await instructions on what to do with it.  
2. It can write and run any Python script, using various libraries like Pandas and matplotlib.  
3. All AI-written files are automatically formatted, so AI can not make any syntactical mistakes.

```
git clone https://github.com/WoutHofstra/dataDuck

2. Move into the projects directory:
```

3. Install the requirements:

```
4. Import your CSV file
